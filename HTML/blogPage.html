          The reform of <b>electronic invoicing</b> , far from being a simple trend, 
          is emerging as an upcoming reality for companies. France, keen to 
          offer a solid and honest <u>“Y” model</u> , recently reviewed the timetable 
          for implementing its <b>tax dematerialization</b> reform . This change aims 
          to ensure a <b>smooth</b> transition for businesses while strengthening the 
          maturity of operating entities.
          <br>
          <br>
          On July 28, an official message from the <b>General Directorate of Public 
          Finance</b> indicated the delay in the general implementation of electronic 
          invoicing, without specifying new deadlines.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now the dates have been set (although they are still subject to explicit validation).
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-semi-title">
          A brief reminder of the history of the electronic invoicing reform
        </h2>
        <p class="para-section-down">
          In 2021, the French government launched with Ordinance <u>No. 2021-1190 of September 15, 2021</u> 
          the ambitious project to modernize invoicing between professionals. Faced with a rapidly 
          changing business world, the idea was to bring <b>clarity</b> and <b>productivity to B2B invoicing</b> 
          processes while combating fraud. Thanks to close collaboration between the administration 
          and various stakeholders, the system has been continually refined to better respond to 
          realities on the ground.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-semi-title">
          Postponement of the initial schedule and reasons
        </h2>
        <p class="para-section-down">
          The complexity and issues associated with such a change led to a major decision: to postpone 
          (once again) the date of entry into force. After numerous consultations with professional 
          federations and companies, it was deemed essential to guarantee a smooth transition by read 
          justing the <b>timetable</b> of obligations concerning <b>E-Invoicing</b>.
          <br>
          <br>
          The reasons for the delay in reform are mainly due to a lack of information and preparation 
          of societies.
          <br>
          <br>
          There was a misestimation of the consequences of the reform on the IT system of <b>the AIFE</b> 
          (State Financial IT Agency).
          <br>
          It is also essential to ensure that the <b>PPF</b> ( <b>Public Billing Portal</b> ) can provide the required 
          protection in the face of increased operational activities.
          <br>
          <b>Companies present heterogeneous</b> levels of progress regarding the adoption of the reform: 
          a quarter of large companies reported that they would not be operational within the timeframe 
          initially planned.
          <br>
          In addition, the information intended for SMEs (numbering 146,000 in France) is considered 
          insufficient.

          <i>Update in October 2023 of the deadlines for Electronic Invoicing obligations</i><br><br>
          Faced with the scale of the reform, the government, after consultation, therefore chose 
          to postpone the date of entry into force of electronic invoicing initially planned for July 1, <b>2024</b> .
          <br>
          <br>
          As part of the finance bill for 2024, amendment No. I-5395  tabled on October 17, 2023 
          by the government postpones the deadlines for electronic invoicing between companies. 
          The E-invoicing obligations will still apply gradually but this time from  September 1, 2026 .
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>• September 1, 2026</b> for Large Businesses (initially planned for July 1, 2024).
          <br>
          <b>• September 1, 2026</b> for ETIs (mid-sized companies), while they were initially targeted for 
          January 1, 2025.
          <br>
          <b>• September 1, 2027</b> for SMEs and micro-enterprises, delayed by one year compared to the initial
           date of January 1, 2026.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-semi-title">
          TO REMEMBER :
        </h2>
        <p class="para-section-diff">
          <b>As of 01/09/2026</b>  :
          <br><br>
          Obligation to receive  electronic invoices for all companies regardless of their size: <br>
          <b> Large Companies, ETIs, SMEs, microenterprises</b> .
          <br>
          <b>Obligation to issue </b> electronic invoices for Large Enterprises (<b>GE</b> ) and <br>
          Intermediate-Sized Enterprises ( <b>ETI</b> ).
          <br>
          <b>From 01/09/2027 </b>: obligation to issue electronic invoices for Small and <br>
          Medium Enterprises (<b> SMEs </b>) and microenterprises.
        </p>
        <p class="para-section-down">
          <i>However, it is essential to note that these dates remain subject to the final adoption of the 
            law.</i>
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-semi-title">
          The principle of electronic invoicing
        </h2>
        <p class="para-section-down">
          The essence of this model is to transform paper invoices into electronic invoices through a 
          process that complies with the <b>requirements of legal and tax regulations</b> . By this we mean 
          not the “paper” invoice which would have simply been converted into an ordinary <b>PDF format 
          and sent by email, but rather a file which brings together a set of data in a structured 
          electronic format</b>. Last but not least, <b>invoices will no longer be exchanged directly 
          between companies</b>.
          <br>

          <br>
          <i>Electronic invoicing model France</i>
          <br><br>
          At the heart of the Billing scheme will be the Administration's <b>Public Billing Platform (PPF)</b>. 
          Companies, failing to be satisfied with the latter very basic, will have to resort to 
          <b>Dematerialization Operators</b> (OD) or <b>Dematerialization Partner Platforms</b> (PDP) in order to 
          benefit from functionalities with higher added value.
          <br><br>
          For more details, see our <u>Electronic invoicing page</u> .
          <br><br>
          <b><u>Electronic invoicing</u></b> will become the exclusive means of invoicing for all companies in France. 
          This change represents a major challenge for <b>Administrative and Financial</b> Directors who must 
          prepare their company for this transition.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-semi-title">
          These new deadlines concern all mandatory data flows to be transmitted to the Tax Administration.
        </h2>
        <p class="para-section-down">
        <b>•  E-INVOICING</b>  : transmission of invoice data with all mandatory data defined by the reform, in 
          transmission and reception.
          <br><br>
        <b>•  E-REPORTING</b> : transmission of transaction data not covered by e-invoicing in the case of 
          exchanges involving a partner established outside France (B2B outside domestic) or a non-taxable 
          person (B2C).
          <br><br>
        <b>•  LIFE CYCLE </b>: transmission of invoice processing statuses, deposited (issuer), 
          rejected (receiver), refused (receiver), collected (issuer).

              It is imperative for businesses to know their obligations . The use of appropriate 
              dematerialization platforms and the addition of new mandatory information on invoices 
              are key steps in addition to the security and conservation of these electronic invoices. 
              But beyond these imperatives, it is crucial to fully understand the need to anticipate the 
              reform for your company and to map the impact on business processes that this will cause.

            The gain in visibility conferred by these new dates, in addition to ensuring consistency with 
            realities on the ground, once again allows us to affirm that Electronic Invoicing is a concrete 
            reality whose importance is no longer subjective. Ignoring this development is simply no longer 
            an option. On the contrary, it requires serious anticipation on the part of companies, especially 
            when we know that the adoption of this new digital practice offers above all enormous advantages: 
            accuracy of information, optimization, speed of processing, increased transparency and better 
            management of financial transactions. All of this constitutes an obvious lever for improvement 
            for companies. ".
